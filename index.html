			<p>Opening Day was our first official Apex event together! We spent our time together out in Fink’s Farm in Long Island, exploring the corn maze, riding the tractor around the farm, visiting different animal bins, and jumping into the corn pit. We came back to P.S. 1 exhausted from all the fun and new experiences we had at the farm!</p>

			<p>Yaya Tea Garden served as a haven for brainstorming ideas for Celine’s personal statement for the Common App. It was her first time thoroughly talking about her interests in photography and with Jenny’s help, she constructed her first outline in her Passion Planner in preparation for her essay. We also talked about life in general while enjoying our Yaya bubble tea.</p>

			<div class="content pure-u-1 pure-u-lg-3-5">
			<p>The Brooklyn Museum located near Prospect Park was an afternoon filled with explorations within the brick building of artifacts and stories. We walked through the floors, and rested for a particularly long time at a very comfortable blue beanbag on the second floor while watching a documentary about the ocean and graphic design. We roamed around and looked at cool artifacts. Afterwards, we spent more time talking about colleges, and Jenny shared her experience at UPenn.</p>

			<p>The mentor and mentee couple were warned of the long day ahead of them -- the Apex Holiday Party was a packed day of entertaining elementary school kids at P.S.1 and ice skating at Prospect Park right afterwards. We arrived to P.S. 1 early in the morning, and helped set up and decorate the Santa Claus photo station. For the rest of the afternoon, we were photographers and took pictures for the little children with Santa! Right after the Holiday Party, we went straight to the ice skating rink. Neither of us could skate very well, but we made it through the rink! </p>

			<img class="bgimg" src="img/1_14_17_flushing.jpg" border="0" />

			<p>It was Celine’s first of many times at bouldering with Jenny. Jenny, as a mentor, guided Celine through the process of climbing up the rocks in the wall. With Lillian and Esther there for company, everyone had a great bonding time. Both Celine and Lillian tried something new, and bouldering definitely became a new hobby for both of us at the end of the day! </p>

			<p>The Apex small group hotpot was one of our first Apex official group meetups. We went to 99 Favor taste in Grand St, and enjoyed an afternoon of savory hotpot for lunch! </p>

			<p>Jenny, Celine, Esther, and Liliian traveled to the Queens Museum for a shot at the Queens Museum Trivia about watersheds in NYC! Since it was related to environmental studies and NYC history, it piqued Lillian’s interest. Though we did not win those cool blue H2O waterbottles, we did learn about Chinatown history and the three major watersheds that provide water to residents in NYC! </p>

			<p>This was the second time out of many for Celine and Lillian, and the first time for Nancy, to go bouldering with the company of Jenny and Esther! Nancy was introduced to our hobby, and she quickly caught up to our skill level. She was dubbed as “the spider-monkey.” </p>

			<p>On an early morning of March, we met up at P.S. 1 and headed towards a snow mountain with the rest of MSMP and HSMP. Once we arrived at the site, we were hit with the freezing cold air, but still made our way to the top of the hill. The first time we slid down the hill, we were slightly “shook,” but we quickly got used to the speed afterwards and even tried going down the hill backwards! At the end of the day, we drank hot chocolate and relaxed in the cabin.</p>

			<p>Jenny introduced Five Senses to Celine, a Korean restaurant located in KTown. It was Celine’s first time going, but the food there was amazing (the seafood pancake was extremely tasty). Coupled with good food and Celine’s intense rendition of the latest Thriller Get Out, the afternoon was an enjoyable one for both the mentor and mentee.</p>

			<p>Who knew cafes were great places to develop code? Celine was struggling on a particular project for her Software Development class, and Jenny offered to give a brief rundown of D3 data visualization. Celine learned about the abundant number of resources and templates for D3 that already exist, and decided to utlize some templates online for her project.</p>
			<p> Above is an example of interactive D3 code. </p>
